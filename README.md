>That of a color - often confused with tan, beige or champagne. My role as a Software Quality Engineer is to ensure that the "correct color" requirement (FAWN) is adhered to and clarify confusion.

## Project Deliverable

The following _API Key_ has been generated from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx, it's _FREE_ but you need to activate it via email.

### Familiarizing myself with the API

- To get the id of the movie to look which forms part of the i: parameter on the query, I Searched for the Title Thor: Ragnarok and obtained the "imdbID:tt3501632" from the JSON response to use in the i parameter.


### **Test cases**
- Test cases are written using the Test Managet tool and where exported to a PDF file.

### Automated Test Scripts
To achieve this task I used postman and exported the JSON collection.

You can download the following collection and import on postman to run and have a much more clearer reading experience [Postman Collection](https://github.com/xolisas/Fawn/blob/master/LisaTestsThorMovie.postman_collection.json)
